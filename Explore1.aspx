        <h2>Your dog is not a prisoner!</h2>
        <p>Unlike other dog boarding centers that keep dogs locked up in kennels through the day, we at Dog House believe in giving dogs ample freedom and space. Dogs boarding at Dog House leave their kennels six times a day to enjoy a walk in our garden and we believe this is the best part of their boarding experience with us. We offer a huge outdoor environment that dogs can exercise and play in. Our kennels are spacious and suited for dogs of different breeds and sizes.</p>
